I"¥	<p>New year, new website. âœ¨</p>

<p>Itâ€™s usually around this time of the year that I start a new side project, adding more work to my plate. But 2020 taught me to do things differently, and Iâ€™ve decided to allow myself to breathe a bit.</p>

<p>If the situation were different, Iâ€™d have paused all my side projects and used the extra free time to travel. The reality is, if weâ€™re following the current plan, I wonâ€™t be vaccinated against COVID 19 before summer 2021, and weâ€™ll go through new lockdowns and curfews before weâ€™re done with this pandemic.</p>

<p>When I first started my design career, side projects were a way for me to add work to my portfolio. Later, I used these projects to take a step back from my â€œdailyâ€ work, which can be monotonous when youâ€™re working on a single product.</p>

<p>At one point, I even left my â€œin-houseâ€ job to join an agency because I thought working on multiple projects would be the solution. But working for agencies never allowed me to dive deep enough into productsâ€¦ and Iâ€™m definitely a product person.</p>

<p>The problem with side projects is that they take a lot of time. When they donâ€™t work, you slowly stop putting effort into them, and when they do work, they can become a source of stress â€” especially when you do everything by yourself.</p>

<p>So I asked myself why I truly enjoyed side projects, and I pinpointed the following reasons:
Designing new things teaches me a lot and brings me satisfaction.
Working on more than one project helps me be more creative.
I enjoy solving problems and helping people.</p>

<p>So, Iâ€™ve decided to pause all of my side projects in 2021.
At least, Iâ€™ll try to ğŸ˜‰</p>

<p>Instead, Iâ€™ll focus on the followings:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Keep helping the Product Hunt community grow and launch amazing products.</li>
  <li>Work on one new project with a team instead of doing it alone.</li>
  <li>Help my fellow designers and product people by sharing resources on my website.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully, this new setup will allow me to have enough diversity in my work not to start unfinishable projects. Iâ€™ll learn new things that will benefit the two products Iâ€™m working on (instead of 5 ğŸ˜…) and my teams.</p>

<p>And when Iâ€™m not working, Iâ€™ll enjoy life with my incredible partner, play video games, read books, work out, try new recipes, take care of my friends and family.</p>

<p>I wish you the best for 2021.
Take care ğŸ’•</p>
